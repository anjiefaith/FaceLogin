Webcam Face Detection with OpenCV
Overview

This project is a real-time face detection application using C++ and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam, detects faces in each frame using Haar Cascade classifiers, and draws red rectangles around detected faces.

Features

Real-time face detection from webcam feed

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces

Adjustable detection parameters (scale factor, min neighbors)

Cross-platform: works on Windows, Linux, and Mac with OpenCV

Technologies Used

Language: C++

Libraries: OpenCV (highgui, imgproc, objdetect)

Tools: Any C++ IDE or compiler (Visual Studio, GCC, etc.)
Usage

The application will open a window displaying your webcam feed.

Faces detected in the video stream will be highlighted with red rectangles.

Press ESC to exit the application.

Potential use:
Control apps or games using gestures and face detection.

Eye-tracking or attention-tracking systems in VR/AR.

Fun filters (like Snapchat, Instagram) that follow your face in real-time.

Motion-capture games that track your face for avatars or expressions.
